/**
 * This class generates an index buffer by connecting up the vertices of the
 * terrain into triangles. The direction of the triangles is flipped for every
 * other grid square, leading to a more interesting pattern. The order that the
 * indices are provided in is also rotated for some triangles, to change which
 * vertex is the "provoking vertex". This is important when using the "flat"
 * type qualifier in the shaders.
